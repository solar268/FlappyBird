# Splashy Fish
FlappyBird-inspired project using Pygame.

**Splashy Fish** is a fun and interactive game inspired by Flappy Bird, where players control a pixelated bird navigating through pipes while trying to avoid obstacles and achieve the highest score. The game includes a scoring system, restart functionality, and a high score tracker.

## Features
- **Responsive controls**: Control the bird with a simple mouse click to navigate through pipes.
- **Scoring system**: Keep track of your score as you fly through the pipes. 
- **Top Scores**: The game saves and displays the top 3 high scores.
- **Restart button**: Easily restart the game after a Game Over.
- **Background music and sound effects**: (Note: Sound effects are optional and can be added later).

## Game Controls
- **Click the mouse** to make the bird flap upwards.
- Avoid hitting the pipes and the ground.
- **Restart** the game using the restart button on the game over screen.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. **Install Pygame**: Install the `pygame` library if you don't have it installed yet. Run the following command:

3. **Run the game**:
